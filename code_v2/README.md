Please put the original data set in the same directory as code files and **rename** the dataset directory to **SFEW**. I also sent the augmentation data to Nathan, which can be directly used if unzipping the file in the same directory as codes.

**augment_data.ipynb** is the code for generating augmenting data. (optional)

**VGG_train.ipynb** is the VGG-16 training model using the pretrained model from torchvision.models (detail in the comments)

**CasCor_train.ipynb** is the CasCor training model
